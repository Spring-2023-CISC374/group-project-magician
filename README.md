# group-game-project

This assignment is where you will submit your code for your MVP as well as the rest of the versions of your educational game.

Sydney Hester: I was the one who copied the code from our phaser game to create a running enviornment for the code. I was also the one
who created all of the scenes and created a way to move between the scenes. I also organized all of the files in the way they are now. (as
displayed in class this past wednesday). I plan to upgrade these things as others complete their parts. Mostly will just have to move the
scene changers to specific update function and collision handlers.
